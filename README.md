# Modeling Credit Risk

During the recent 3 years, my main job is to develop credit risk models for a Chinese commercial bank. 

In this repository, I want to summarize my experience of developing such kind of models. The main task in risk modeling is to classify the applicants as low risk client and high risk clients. So mostly we used classification models such as binary regression models and tree models.
